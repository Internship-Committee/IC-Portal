/* ============================================================
   IC Portal — Central configuration
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   This is the ONLY file you should need to edit when connecting
   the real Google Sheet. Every page reads its data source from here.

   HOW THE GOOGLE SHEET CONNECTION WORKS
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   The site reads each tab of the sheet below as CSV, directly —
   no Apps Script, no "Publish to web" step, no per-tab links to
   generate. It only needs two things to be true:

   1. The sheet is shared as "Anyone with the link → Viewer"
      (Share button, top right of the Google Sheet).
   2. The tab names in the sheet exactly match `sheetTabs` below,
      and the column headers match README.md's "Spreadsheet
      schemas" section.

   Once both are true, flip the matching `useLocalData` flag to
   `false` and that page reads live from the sheet on every load.
   That's it — no other file needs to change.
